Movie Recommender System
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System! This project uses machine learning algorithms to recommend movies to users based on their preferences.
Introduction
The Movie Recommender System is a machine learning project designed to predict which movies a user might like based on their viewing history. The system uses a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to generate personalized movie recommendations.

Features:
User-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on the similarity between users.
Item-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on the similarity between movies.
Content-based Filtering: Recommends movies by analyzing the metadata (genres, actors, directors, etc.) of the movies the user has liked.
Hybrid Model: Combines both collaborative and content-based filtering for improved recommendations.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes movie ratings and metadata, such as genres, directors, and cast information. It is sourced from the MovieLens dataset and is preprocessed for use in the model.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Techniques: Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, NLTK
Model Description
The recommendation engine combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to predict user preferences. The key components include:

Similarity Calculation: Uses cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between users or items.
Matrix Factorization: Implements Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to factorize the user-item matrix.
Hybrid Approach: Combines both collaborative and content-based models to enhance recommendation accuracy.
